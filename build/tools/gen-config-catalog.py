"""Generate app/Madeira/ConfigCatalog.generated.swift: every option Madeira reads.

Two kinds of option live in Documents/madeira.cfg:
  - plain keys ("vram-mb = 4352"), read through build/madeira_cfg.h
    (madeira_cfg_get/int/bool), the D3D12 runtime (mad_cfg_int_pe/str_pe) or
    the app (MadeiraConfig.get/bool/flag);
  - environment switches ("env.NAME = value"), which the app exports before
    Wine starts; any MADEIRA_*/DXMT_*/MYTHIC_* name the code reads with getenv,
    GetEnvironmentVariable, env::getEnvVar, madeiraSwitch or a flag helper.

The scan covers the tracked sources of this repository and of the wine, DXMT
and FEX submodules. Each option gets its type and default from the reading
call, a subsystem from the file it is read in, and the comment next to the
first read. OVERLAY adds titles and fixed choices for the options that have a
dedicated place in Settings.
